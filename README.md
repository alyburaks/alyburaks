# Hi, I'm Alyssa Buraks!

I’m a Computer Science and Business Management student at Northeastern University with a concentration in Marketing. My journey, both academically and athletically, has taught me resilience, teamwork, and the importance of adaptability. These are skills I bring into every aspect of my life.

My background in track, swim, and soccer has shaped me into a disciplined, goal-oriented individual who thrives under pressure. I’ve learned that preparation, strategy, and perseverance are key to achieving excellence. These same principles drive my passion for technology and business, where I enjoy solving complex challenges and collaborating with others to create meaningful solutions.
